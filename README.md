# Xgrep

A library and script for linux users that combines indexing
directories and grepping files. Essentially it helps the user not have
to remember the details of *find | xargs grep...*


# Purpose

The following is the intent:

* Allow creation/stroage of common searches in a database.

* Allow creation of file sets that can be incorporated into a search.

* Automatically update databases for searches. Default implementation uses updatedb and mlocate.

* Provide the *find|grep* in single script with less to remember


# Examples

* TODO
